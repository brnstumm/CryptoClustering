# CryptoClustering

Purpose:  Predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  Create a new scaled dataframe and set the index from the original DataFrame.  Create an elbow curve to cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using both Originial data and PCA data.

Process: Create DataFrames for both types: original and PCA.  Then find the best K-mean value using the elbow method to determine this data.  Then compare the two sets by plotting the information.

Resources:  Class notes and reviewed the process with a tutor.
